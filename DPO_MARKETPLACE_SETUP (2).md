# üè™ DPO Marketplace Setup Instructions

## Quick Revolutionary Setup

```bash
# 1. Navigate to marketplace directory
cd dpo-anarcho-syndicalist-marketplace

# 2. Install revolutionary dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the revolution
npm run dev
```

## Integration with Existing ULP Systems

### 1. Sacred Geometry Integration
The marketplace automatically integrates with the Sacred Geometry Harmony app:
- Personality-based cooperative matching
- Golden ratio pricing algorithms  
- Sacred geometry UI components

### 2. Knowledge System Connection
Connects to existing knowledge systems:
- Enhanced cooperative search using knowledge trie
- Revolutionary content filtering
- Knowledge-backed reputation system

### 3. Attention Token System
Implements the ULP attention token economy:
- Knowledge-backed cryptocurrency
- Proof-of-cooperation mining
- Mutual aid multipliers

## Revolutionary Development Workflow

1. **Component Development**: Create new cooperative features in `src/components/`
2. **Economic Principles**: Implement new economic models in `src/services/`
3. **UI Integration**: Use Revolutionary Theme for consistent anarcho-syndicalist design
4. **Testing**: Test cooperative interactions and anti-exploitation safeguards
5. **Community Deployment**: Deploy to decentralized infrastructure
