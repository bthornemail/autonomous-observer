# Contributing Guidelines

- Branching: use feature/topic-name from dev-copilot.
- Commits: small, focused, with clear messages.
- Tests: add/adjust when changing behavior.
- Docs: update README/docs when needed.
- Style: follow .editorconfig; prefer LF line endings.
- PRs: include context, risks, and validation notes. Use the PR template.
- Security: never commit secrets; scrub logs and fixtures.
- Tools: after edits, run Codacy MCP analysis for changed files.
