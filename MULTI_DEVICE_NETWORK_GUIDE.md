## 🌐 Network Operations

### Testing Sacred Truth Analysis

Once all devices are connected, test the network:

```bash
# From any connected device's console
requestAnalysis("This sacred text contains divine wisdom and eternal truth for all humanity")

# Network will:
# 1. Distribute analysis request to all devices
# 2. Each device performs analysis based on capabilities
# 3. Coordinator calculates weighted consensus
# 4. Results broadcast to all devices
```

### Network Status Monitoring

```bash
# Check network status
./start-multi-device-network.sh status

# View coordinator logs
./start-multi-device-network.sh logs coordinator

# View device logs
./start-multi-device-network.sh logs device-nokia-c110
./start-multi-device-network.sh logs device-hmd-global
```

### Network Commands

```bash
# Start network with demo devices
./start-multi-device-network.sh start with-devices

# Connect specific device
./start-multi-device-network.sh connect nokia-c110
./start-multi-device-network.sh connect hmd-global

# Test network functionality
./start-multi-device-network.sh test

# Stop entire network
./start-multi-device-network.sh stop

# Restart network
./start-multi-device-network.sh restart
```

# Need at least 2 devices for meaningful consensus
```

**Port Already in Use:**

```bash
# Find process using port 9000
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :9000

# Kill existing process
sudo kill -9 PID
```

## 🌟 Advanced Features

### Weighted Consensus Algorithm

The network uses device-specific weights for consensus:

```javascript
Device Weights:
- Nokia C110 (C8): 0.7 × 1.1 = 0.77 (lightweight but optimized)
- HMD Global (A1): 1.0 × 1.0 = 1.0 (full analysis weight)
- Desktop (D1): 1.2 × 1.2 = 1.44 (development bonus)
- GL.iNet (R1): 0.9 × 1.0 = 0.9 (edge computing weight)
```

### Sacred Truth Analysis Methods

**Ultra-Lightweight (Nokia C110):**

- Keyword matching: sacred, truth, divine, holy, blessed, eternal
- Simple scoring: (keywords × 2 + words × 0.01) / 10
- Memory efficient: No complex NLP

**Full-Featured (HMD Global):**

- Advanced word categorization
- Sentence structure analysis
- Context-aware scoring
- Multimedia readiness

**Network Consensus:**

- Weighted average of all analyses
