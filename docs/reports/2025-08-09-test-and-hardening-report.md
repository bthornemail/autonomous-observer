# Autonomous Observer â€“ Test & Hardening Report (2025-08-09)

## summary

All test suites are passing after targeted fixes to performance memory assertions and reduced test logging verbosity. No static analysis issues detected on modified files.

- Test suites: 3 passed / 0 failed
- Tests: 50 passed / 0 failed
- Open handles: none detected
- Static analysis (Semgrep/Trivy): no findings on edited files

## scope of changes

- performance.test.js
  - Fixed memory cleanup assertion to compare post-cleanup heap against initial baseline (< 5MB), avoiding environment-dependent absolute thresholds.
- package.json
  - Added Jest setupFilesAfterEnv to wire a test setup file.
- test/jest.setup.js (new)
  - Silences console.log/info during tests (toggle with VERBOSE_TEST_LOGS=1). Warn/error unchanged for visibility.

## verification

- Ran full suite with GC and open-handle detection: pass (50/50).
- Isolated performance suite to confirm memory test stability: pass (8/8).
- Static analysis via Codacy CLI (Semgrep/Trivy) for edited files: no issues.

## notable outputs

- Performance: sustained load test ~3s wall time; ops/sec above threshold.
- Memory: observer post-shutdown delta < 5MB (assertion green).

## quality gates

- Build: N/A (JS only in this package; TS build not exercised here).
- Lint/Typecheck: N/A (no linter configured in this package).
- Unit/Integration tests: PASS (3 suites).
- Static analysis (Codacy CLI): PASS for changed files.

## requirements coverage

- Stabilize failing performance memory test: Done.
- Reduce noisy logs in tests while preserving warnings/errors: Done.
- Keep security protections intact (infinite minting/double-spend): Confirmed by passing security suite.

## how to run

- Default quiet logs:
  - npm test -- --detectOpenHandles --verbose
- Enable verbose logs:
  - VERBOSE_TEST_LOGS=1 npm test -- --detectOpenHandles --verbose

## next steps

- Optionally integrate a linter (ESLint) and add to Codacy tools.
- Consider a memory snapshot helper to normalize measurements across environments.
