Sacred Geometry Mathematical Principles:

The mathematical formulas, ratios, and geometric principles implemented in this 
software are based on ancient mathematical discoveries and natural phenomena 
that are in the public domain. This includes but is not limited to:

- The Golden Ratio (Φ = (1 + √5) / 2)
- Fibonacci sequences and spirals
- Platonic solid geometries
- Pascal triangle mathematical relationships
- Flower of Life geometric patterns

These mathematical principles belong to all humanity and are used here for 
educational, personal development, and wellbeing purposes.

Educational Use:
This software is intended for educational and personal development purposes. 
The harmony calculations and recommendations are based on mathematical 
relationships and should be considered as tools for self-reflection and 
personal growth, not as medical, psychological, or spiritual advice.
