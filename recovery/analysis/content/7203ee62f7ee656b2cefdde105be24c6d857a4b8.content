This is an FTP client library for Node.js. It supports FTPS over TLS, Passive Mode over IPv6, has a Promise-based API, and offers methods to operate on whole directories. Active Mode is not supported.

## Advisory

Prefer alternative transfer protocols like HTTPS or SFTP (SSH). FTP is a an old protocol with some reliability issues. Use this library when you have no choice and need to use FTP. Try to use FTPS (FTP over TLS) whenever possible, FTP alone does not provide any security.

## Dependencies

Node 10.0 or later is the only dependency.

## Installation

`npm install basic-ftp`
