# Branch Verification Report - Phase 2
## Timestamp: 2025-08-11T06:25:10Z

## Branch Status Analysis
Total branches analyzed: 19
- **Active branches with divergence**: 14
- **Synchronized branches**: 5 (live-protocol, live-protocol-test, main, origin, science-knowledge)

## Critical Divergence Patterns
1. **MCP branch**: 83 ahead, 131 behind → Major feature branch
2. **MCP-codacy branch**: 124 ahead, 131 behind → Extensive development
3. **claude branch**: 110 ahead, 131 behind → Significant work
4. **history-recovery-mcp**: 40 ahead, 0 behind → Current recovery work
5. **singularity branch**: 99 ahead, 131 behind → Legacy singularity2d work

## Dangling Objects Status
- **Remaining unreachable objects**: 41,055 (increased from 11,645)
- **Status**: Phase 1 recovery successful but revealed deeper issues
- **Pattern**: Recovery process exposed additional orphaned content

## Recommendations
1. Continue with autonomous-observer submodule integration
2. Focus on singularity branch extraction for Singularity2D patterns
3. Implement cross-branch merge strategy for critical divergences
4. Use MCP tools for systematic timeline reconstruction
